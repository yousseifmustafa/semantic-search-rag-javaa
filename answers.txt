Question:
How does Deep Learning differ from traditional Machine Learning?
Answer:
According to the provided text, Deep Learning differs from traditional Machine Learning in that:

* In traditional Machine Learning, features are often hand-crafted and need to be engineered by humans.
* In Deep Learning, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically.

Additionally, the text notes that the term "deep" in "Deep Learning" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed, whereas traditional Machine Learning typically involves a shallower level of abstraction.
