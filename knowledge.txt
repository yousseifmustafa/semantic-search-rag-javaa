Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of simulating human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding. Since its foundation as an academic discipline in 1956, AI has rapidly evolved, leading to applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and advanced game-playing systems. AI research spans subfields like machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and knowledge representation. Machine Learning (ML), a core subset of AI, develops algorithms that learn from data and is typically divided into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Deep Learning, a branch of ML, leverages multilayered neural networks inspired by the human brain to achieve breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, powering models like GPT, LLaMA, and BERT. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand and generate human language, while computer vision allows systems to interpret images and videos. Robotics integrates AI with mechanical engineering to build autonomous and semi-autonomous machines. Across industries, AI is applied in healthcare (diagnostics, personalized treatment, drug discovery), finance (fraud detection, trading, risk analysis), education (adaptive learning), and transportation (autonomous driving). Despite its transformative potential, AI raises challenges such as bias, lack of transparency, job displacement, data privacy, and ethical risks, highlighting the importance of responsible AI development to maximize benefits while minimizing harm.
